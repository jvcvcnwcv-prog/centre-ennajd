/**
 * Builds the payments matrix for one resolved session's roster.
 * `basePrice` is the level+subject+groupType base price for this exact
 * session (all students in this roster share the same group type, since
 * the roster is pinned to a single Session) — used only to flag
 * custom-discounted (Takhfid) installments, never to recompute amounts.
 *
 * The `isDiscounted` flag compares each month's frozen `amountDue` against
 * the amount the session-based engine EXPECTS for that month at the BASE
 * price (`computeExpectedMonthAmount`). Legitimately prorated months (a
 * mid-month join) match their expected amount and carry no flag; the flag
 * appears only when a real `customPrice` moved the amount off the base
 * expectation.
